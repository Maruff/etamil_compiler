//! Where the VM's input and output actually go.
//!
//! The interpreter used to call `std::fs` and `println!` directly, which tied
//! it to an operating system: it could not be built for the browser, and it
//! could not be tested without touching the disk. Both are now behind this
//! module.
//!
//! This is a `#[cfg]`-selected module rather than a trait the VM holds. A trait
//! would be the more general answer, but it would mean threading a `&mut dyn
//! Host` through every method of a 2,000-line interpreter and changing every
//! signature on the way. Swapping `fs::write(..)` for `host::write(..)` changes
//! the call and nothing else. If the VM ever needs two hosts alive at once --
//! two programs running side by side in one process -- this becomes a trait,
//! and the call sites do not move again.
//!
//! On wasm, output accumulates in a buffer the embedder drains, and files live
//! in memory. Both are `thread_local`: wasm32 is single-threaded, so there is
//! nothing to lock, and a native build gets one host per thread, which is what
//! a thread-per-request server wants.
