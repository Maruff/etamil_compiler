//! The runtime the LLVM backend's emitted IR calls into.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The backend used to compute in `f64`, then in `i64`. Both are the same
//! bargain in different clothes: the IR holds the value directly, so the
//! language shrinks to whatever fits in a register. Numbers fit. Strings,
//! arrays, records, results and `இன்மை` do not, and neither does a decimal —
//! `1 / 3` is `0.3333333333333333333333333333` on the VM and there is no
//! register that holds that.
//!
//! So the IR stops holding values. Every eTamil value is an `i64` **handle**
//! into an arena that lives here, and every operation on one is a call into
//! this module. That is the ordinary way to compile a dynamically typed
//! language, and it buys three things that matter more than the call overhead:
//!
//! 1. **Decimals are exact, because this is the same `rust_decimal` the VM
//!    uses.** Not a fixed two-place approximation — the actual type. `0.1 + 0.2`
//!    is `0.3` and `1 / 3` prints all twenty-eight digits, in both backends,
//!    for the same reason rather than by coincidence.
//! 2. **Formatting cannot drift**, because printing calls `Value::to_string`,
//!    the function the VM prints through. Trailing zeros are trimmed in one
//!    place, not two.
//! 3. **All fifty-nine builtins work at once**, because `etamil_call` goes
//!    through `VM::invoke_builtin` — the dispatch the bytecode interpreter
//!    uses. `நீளம்` is not reimplemented here, so it cannot disagree.
//!
//! ## The cost
//!
//! `output.ll` is no longer self-contained. It has to be linked against this:
//!
//! ```text
//! clang output.ll -o prog -L target/release -letamil_compiler \
//!       -Wl,-rpath,target/release
//! ```
//!
//! `Cargo.toml` already builds the `cdylib`, so nothing new is produced; these
//! functions are simply exported from it.
//!
//! ## Handles
//!
//! A handle is an index into a thread-local arena. Handle 0 is always `இன்மை`.
//! Nothing is ever freed: a compiled program runs and exits, and an arena that
//! only grows cannot dangle, cannot double-free, and needs no reference counts
//! in the emitted IR. A long-running program compiled this way would grow
//! without bound, which is the honest limitation of the approach and the reason
//! the VM remains the way to run a server.
//!
//! Every function here is `extern "C"` and takes and returns handles or plain
//! integers, so `codegen.rs` needs no knowledge of `Value`'s layout.
