//! Browser stand-ins for the modules that need a socket.
//!
//! `db`, `redis` and `http` are real modules on a native build and absent on
//! wasm. The interpreter holds their types in its own struct fields
//! (`cache: Option<redis::Connection>`, a `db::pool::Lease` per connection) and
//! calls into them from match arms all through `execute`. Gating every one of
//! those would put roughly forty-five `#[cfg]` attributes inside a 2,000-line
//! file.
//!
//! So instead of removing the modules, this re-creates just the surface the
//! interpreter actually touches -- sixteen items -- as types that compile and
//! functions that fail. The interpreter needs no change at all, and a program
//! that asks for a database in the browser gets a sentence explaining why it
//! cannot have one rather than a compile error nobody sees.
//!
//! `net.rs` already did exactly this for its own HTTP client, under
//! `#[cfg(not(feature = "http-client"))]`. This is the same idea, one level up.
//!
//! When the browser VM grows real storage -- IndexedDB behind `db`, say -- these
//! stop being stubs and become implementations. Nothing else moves.

/// Everything here is unreachable by construction: the only constructors return
/// `Err`. Kept type-accurate rather than deleted so the interpreter compiles
/// against one shape on both targets.
