//! ECDSA over P-256 — signatures that a bank or a ledger will accept.
//!
//! HMAC, which this crate already had, proves a message came from someone who
//! holds the same secret you do. That is enough for a webhook and not enough
//! for anything else: both sides can forge each other's messages, so neither
//! can prove to a third party which of them sent one.
//!
//! A signature here is made with a private key and checked with a public one,
//! so the holder of the key is the only party who could have produced it. That
//! is what Hyperledger Fabric requires of an MSP identity, and what a bank
//! requires of a request that moves money.
//!
//! P-256 with SHA-256 specifically, because that is what Fabric's default MSP
//! uses and what most Indian banking APIs specify.
//!
//! Keys and signatures cross into the language as lowercase hex, the same way
//! HMAC signatures already do — a private key is the 32-byte scalar, a public
//! key the 65-byte uncompressed SEC1 point, and a signature is ASN.1 DER,
//! which is the encoding Fabric and X.509 both expect.
