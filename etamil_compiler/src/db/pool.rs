//! Keeping connections alive between requests.
//!
//! Every HTTP request gets a fresh VM, so a handler that opens a database
//! opened a new connection each time and threw it away — a TCP connect, a TLS
//! handshake and an authentication round trip per request, to run one query.
//!
//! What this is **not** is a shared connection. Two requests using one
//! connection would share its transaction state: a `BEGIN` in one would
//! enclose the other's queries, and a `COMMIT` in one would commit the other's
//! half-finished work. Order placement in examples/katY depends on exactly
//! that not happening. So a connection is leased *exclusively* for as long as
//! a VM holds it, and only returns to the cache when the VM is done with it.
//!
//! It is an idle cache with a cap rather than a fixed-size pool: if nothing is
//! idle, a new connection is opened rather than waiting for one. A fixed pool
//! would need blocking and a bound on how long to block, and a request that
//! deadlocks waiting for a connection is worse than one that opens a second.
