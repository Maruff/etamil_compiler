//! Browser bindings for the eTamil front end.
//!
//! The editor on etamil.in runs the real compiler front end rather than a
//! reimplementation of it, so a diagnostic in the browser is the same
//! diagnostic `etamil` prints on the command line -- including the bilingual
//! message text, which comes straight from each error type's `Display`.
//!
//! Two things are reachable from here: `lexer` -> `parser` -> `check`, for
//! diagnostics and the symbol queries, and `vm`, for `run` and
//! `run_with_input`. What the VM cannot do in a browser it refuses explicitly
//! rather than silently: the modules behind databases, sockets and `உள்ளிடு`
//! are gated out of a wasm build, so a program that reaches for one gets a
//! message saying it needs a machine of its own. See lib.rs.
//!
//! The whole of the surface a browser sees, and the only index of it:
//!
//! | export | what it answers |
//! |---|---|
//! | `diagnostics` | the compiler's own positioned, bilingual errors |
//! | `symbols` | every name a source defines |
//! | `symbols_at` | the names visible from one position |
//! | `script_spans` | which ASCII is eTamil script rather than English |
//! | `run` | the program, on the bytecode VM |
//! | `run_with_input` | the same, with stdin supplied |
//! | `version` | the compiler version |
//!
//! `scripts/check_wasm_boundary.py` fails if an export is missing from that
//! table, because this comment went stale twice before anyone noticed.
//!
//! Every entry point returns a `String` rather than a `JsValue` -- JSON for
//! the six that carry structure, plain text for `version`. That keeps the
//! dependency list at `wasm-bindgen` alone -- no `serde-wasm-bindgen`, no
//! `js-sys` -- and the payloads are small enough that one `JSON.parse` on the
//! JavaScript side costs nothing measurable.
