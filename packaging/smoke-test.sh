# Run by the release workflow before anything is published: a package that
# cannot execute its own examples is not a package, and finding that out after
# the release is worse than failing the build.
#
# This is a script rather than a block of YAML on purpose. The checks involve
# Tamil literals and a piped stdin, both of which are easy to get wrong through
# a workflow's quoting, and impossible to test without pushing a tag. Here it
# can be run locally exactly as CI runs it.
