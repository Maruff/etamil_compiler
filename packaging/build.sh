# musl is worth it for the Linux package: the default gnu target links against
# the build machine's glibc, so a binary built on a current Ubuntu will not run
# on an older one. musl produces a fully static ELF that runs anywhere.
#
# The CRT is linked statically on Windows so the package does not depend on the
# Visual C++ Redistributable — otherwise the "no dependencies" claim is false on
# a clean machine.
