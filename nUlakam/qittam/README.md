# qittam — திட்டச் செலவு (project costing)

`celavu/` costs a product: a thing made repeatedly, where the question is how
much of each period's spending reached a unit. This directory costs a
**project**: a thing made once, where the question is different and harder —
how much of the work is actually done, and what will the rest cost.

The two share their arithmetic. Earned value is standard costing applied to a
project, and `Ittu_maqippu.qmz` and `celavu/niyamam.qmz` compute the same kind
of variance from the same kind of flexed budget. What changes is the measure of
output: a production order counts units, a project counts budget earned.

## Five decisions worth knowing

### Spend against budget answers nothing

A project has a budget of 1,550 and has spent 775. Is it in trouble?

The question has no answer, and that is why `Ittu_maqippu.qmz` exists. Two
numbers cannot describe three variables: spend says how much money left, budget
says how much was meant to, and neither says anything about **work
accomplished**. The test file pins the case exactly — a conventional report
reads **+25 favourable** while the cost variance is **−155** and the schedule
variance **−180**. The two readings disagree in direction, not degree.

### Schedule variance is money, not time

`கால_வேறுபாடு` of −180 does not mean the project is 180 behind. It means the
work not yet done was *budgeted* at 180. Converting that to time needs the
schedule — `pAqY.qmz` — not this module. Everyone meets this once.

### Percent complete is a rule, not an opinion

The hard part of earned value is not the arithmetic, it is deciding how much of
a package is done, and "about 80%" has been the status of many packages for
many months. Three conventions remove the judgement — `முறை_0_100`,
`முறை_50_50`, `முறை_மைல்கற்கள்` — and the module deliberately offers **no
function that accepts a typed-in percentage**.

### The WBS is stored flat

A list of nodes each naming its parent, not nested records. A nested record
cannot be indexed by code without walking it; re-parenting is a field
assignment rather than a rebuild; and the roll-up is a fold either way. The
root's parent code is the empty string.

`நூறு_விதி_சரியா` compares a parent's entered budget against its children's,
because a parent with more has work nobody has been assigned and one with less
has work counted twice. Both are invisible in a tree view. `விதியை_சரிபார்`
returns the offending node and both figures rather than a boolean — "the WBS
does not balance" is not actionable.

### Only critical activities are worth crashing

`மலிவான_வேட்பாளர்` takes the list of critical activity codes as an argument and
will not return anything outside it. Shortening an activity with float buys
nothing at all and is the most expensive mistake available, because it looks
like progress. The tests assert it: C is cheaper per day than D and is never
offered, because C has five days of float.

### The point of total assumption is the number nobody writes down

On a fixed price incentive contract the buyer shares an overrun only until the
price reaches the ceiling. Past that the buyer pays no more, so every further
rupee is the seller's alone.

    PTA = target cost + (ceiling price − target price) ÷ buyer's share

The tests prove the formula against itself: at the PTA the final price *is* the
ceiling, exactly. With a target cost of ₹1,00,000, a ₹10,000 fee, a ₹1,25,000
ceiling and a 75/25 split, the point is ₹1,20,000 — and ₹10,000 of overrun
below it costs the seller ₹2,500 while the next ₹10,000 costs ₹10,000. **The
marginal rate quadruples at a point that appears in none of the contract's
schedules**, and a seller tracking cost against target sees nothing happen
there.

The ceiling applies to the price, not to the fee, so past the point the fee
goes negative and the seller is paying to finish. Capping it at zero would hide
that.

### The same overrun costs four different amounts

A ₹30,000 overrun on the same job: the fixed price seller loses ₹20,000, the
incentive seller ₹5,000, and the cost plus seller nothing at all — it still
earns its full fee. `மிகைச்_செலவின்_விளைவு` puts them side by side, because a
cost variance reported without naming the contract type is half a fact.

A not-to-exceed ceiling on a time-and-materials contract is the one most often
misread: the buyer treats it as a budget and the seller as an estimate, and
past it the seller works for nothing exactly as under a fixed price. The switch
is invisible until it happens.

### A lag is time nobody owns

`qotarpu.qmz` adds the other three dependency types and lag. Each constraint
becomes a lower bound on the successor's early start, which is what lets all
four run in one pass, and both passes settle to a fixed point so a cycle fails
loudly rather than looping.

A **lag** is elapsed time with no activity, no cost and no owner — the
commonest way a schedule conceals a dependency on somebody outside the project:
concrete curing, a permit, a supplier's lead time. It appears in no resource
plan and no budget. In the tests, six of the eleven days are lag —
`தாமதப்_பங்கு` reports **54.55%** — and a project whose critical path runs
mostly through other people's organisations will not be shortened by managing
this one's resources.

A **lead** — a negative lag — asserts that the work can overlap. If that is
true then it is two activities, not one with a lead, and the lead hides the
decomposition so nobody can check the claim or resource it. `முன்னோட்டங்கள்`
lists them rather than counting them, because each is a claim that should be
evidenced or rewritten.

### An activity can have zero float and still be pointless to crash

This is the sharpest consequence of the richer relationships, and it qualifies
`curukkal.qmz` directly.

An activity's duration reaches its successor **only through a relationship that
depends on its finish**. Through a start-to-start the successor is tied to the
predecessor's *start*, so shortening the predecessor moves nothing at all.

In the tests the critical path A–C–D carries eleven days of work and five of
lag, and only **six days are crashable**: A is critical, has zero float, and
drives C by start-to-start, so buying a day of A buys nothing.
`curukkal.qmz`, which looks only at float, would happily price it.

## Where it stops

- **`pAqY.qmz` is still finish-to-start only**, deliberately. The richer
  scheduler is `qotarpu.qmz` alongside it rather than a rewrite of it: a
  network a hand calculation can check is worth keeping, and the two agree on
  the case they share.
- **No resource levelling.** It is an optimisation problem with no efficient
  exact solution, and a heuristic that cannot explain what it did will not be
  trusted.
- **Crashing is not automated.** The module gives the slope, the candidate and
  the totals; the caller loops, because the critical path changes after every
  step and where several paths are critical one activity per path must be
  crashed. `கூட்டுச்_சரிவு` prices that comparison.
- **No Monte Carlo.** Three-point estimates and PERT belong with it, and both
  need a random source the standard library does not yet have.

The passes in `pAqY.qmz` iterate to a fixed point rather than running over a
topological sort. For hand-built networks the cost is irrelevant, and the
benefit is that a cycle produces a `தவறு` from `சுழற்சி_உள்ளதா` rather than a
stack overflow. A cycle is the commonest structural error in a network and it
must fail loudly.
