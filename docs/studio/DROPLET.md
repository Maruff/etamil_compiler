# The eTamil droplet

`201.79.9.90` — DigitalOcean, 2 vCPU, 3.8 GiB RAM, 77 G disk, Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS.
Hostname `eTamil-paRY`.

Every figure below was measured on the machine, not estimated. Where something
is untested it says so.

---

## What it runs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Nginx** | reverse proxy and TLS for the demo domains |
| **PostgreSQL 16** | tuned for a small box: `shared_buffers=128MB`, `max_connections=20`, `work_mem=4MB` |
| **eTamil 1.1.0** | `/usr/local/bin/etamil`, from the release tarball — **includes the PostgreSQL driver** |
| **Ollama** | `granite3.3:2b` (1.5 G) and `llama3.2:3b` (2.0 G) |
| **Toolchains** | Rust 1.98.1, LLVM 18.1.3, Python 3.12.3 + pip, Node 22.23.3 + npm 10.9.9 |
| **Hardening** | UFW (22/80/443), fail2ban, unattended-upgrades, 4 GiB swap at `vm.swappiness=10` |

### What it deliberately does not run

- **etamil.in** — GitHub Pages. Free, CDN-backed, zero server RAM.
- **The browser editor** — WebAssembly in the visitor's browser. Costs the
  droplet nothing at any traffic level.
- **Code generation** — needs a 14B model and 16 GB. See
  [MVP.md](MVP.md#measured-on-the-droplet-2026-09-25).

## Memory budget

The whole serving stack is 482 MB. The model is the only large consumer.

| state | used | free |
|---|---|---|
| serving — Nginx, PostgreSQL, four apps | **482 MB** | 3.4 G |
| serving + a model answering | 2,304 MB | 1.6 G |
| serving + an LLVM build | 2,026 MB | 1.9 G |
| **serving + model + build** | **3,848 MB** | **67 MB — do not** |

Either a model or a build fits comfortably. Both at once does not.

## Stopping Ollama for a build

`OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30s` is configured, so a model unloads 30 seconds after the
last request and an idle box usually has the RAM already. Stop it explicitly
for a long build, where someone might use the assistant halfway through.

```bash
systemctl stop ollama
cd /root/src/etamil_compiler
LLVM_SYS_180_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-18 cargo build --release --features llvm -j2
systemctl start ollama
```

One line, from your own machine:

```bash
ssh root@201.79.9.90 "systemctl stop ollama && cd /root/src/etamil_compiler && LLVM_SYS_180_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-18 cargo build --release --features llvm -j2; systemctl start ollama"
```

The `;` before the restart rather than `&&` is deliberate: Ollama comes back
whether the build succeeded or failed.

**Nothing needs stopping in the other direction.** Builds are occasional and
manual; if one is running when a request arrives, the model simply loads more
slowly. There is no rule to remember for using the AI.

### Measured build times

Both from a clean clone, `-j2`, Ollama stopped:

| build | time | peak memory |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo build --release` | 471 s | 1,643 MB |
| `cargo build --release --features llvm` | 229 s | 1,544 MB |

Swap was not touched. The LLVM build is faster only because it reuses the
first build's dependencies.

**The release binary is the one to deploy**, not a source build: `cargo build
--release` omits the PostgreSQL driver, and a program using `தளம்_இணை
போச்குரசீகுல்` then fails at its first query with *"this build has no
PostgreSQL support"*. The tarball from GitHub releases has it. Verified on
this machine.

## Domains

| domain | state |
|---|---|
| `qos.ae` | ✅ HTTPS, placeholder page, certificate to 2026-12-24 |
| `kelir.org` | ✅ HTTPS, placeholder page, certificate to 2026-12-24 |
| `conf.ae` | ⏳ HTTP only — see below |
| `api.kelir.org` | resolves here; awaits the kElir API deploy |
| `ineo.in` | hosted elsewhere, to be moved |

Placeholders are static files at `/var/www/<name>/index.html`, served by nginx
directly — no application, no port, no service. To serve a real site, replace
the `location` block in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<name>` with a
`proxy_pass`; the header comment in each file shows how.

`configure-domains.sh` in this directory does all of it and is safe to re-run:
it skips any domain that does not resolve to this machine, and leaves existing
certificates alone.

### conf.ae

Two certbot attempts failed. The cause is not this machine:

```
Invalid response from http://conf.ae/... 194.39.149.163: 404
```

All four authoritative nameservers return `201.79.9.90`, as do Google,
Cloudflare, Quad9 and OpenDNS. Let's Encrypt's own resolver still held the
previous host. **The record's TTL is 7200 s**, so the stale copy expires within
two hours of the change.

Retry once after that:

```bash
certbot --nginx -d conf.ae -d www.conf.ae --non-interactive --agree-tos -m esan@etamil.in --redirect
```

Let's Encrypt allows five failed validations per domain per hour and `conf.ae`
has used two. Do not retry in a loop.

## What the AI can and cannot do here

Measured, on the six-task and comprehension benchmarks. Harnesses are under
`/root/` on the droplet.

| capability | result |
|---|---|
| Explain a compiler error | ✅ **5/5** |
| Summarise what a program does | ✅ **5/5** |
| Find the right `nUlakam` function | ⚠️ works **when retrieval shortlists it** — the model chose correctly 3/3 |
| Predict what a program prints | ❌ **1/7** |
| Write new eTamil from English | ❌ **2/6** |

Two things follow.

**Retrieval is the bottleneck, not the model.** Recall over the 604 `nUlakam`
functions was 4/8 by keyword and 4/8 by embedding, because 97 functions have no
English doc comment and the rest are terse — `ரூபாய்` reads "the same, with the
rupee sign". Nothing can retrieve what is not described. Writing one English
line per function fixes this without touching the model.

**Generation needs 14B.** `qwen2.5:14b` scored 18/20 on a 16 GB box; nine
models inside 4 GB topped out at 2/6. That is a hardware decision, not a
prompt-engineering one.

The two failures matter less than they look: the Studio can simply *run* a
program to show its output, and the compiler already reports its own errors.
The model's job is explaining them.

## Services

All enabled at boot:

```
nginx  postgresql  ollama  fail2ban  unattended-upgrades
```

`unattended-upgrades` **will reboot the machine** when a package requires it —
it did so during setup, taking `libc6`. If an unannounced reboot is
unacceptable once the demo apps carry traffic, set
`Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "false";` in
`/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` and watch
`/var/run/reboot-required` instead.
