// Which compiler runs, and what it can see.
//
// Until this file existed the extension only knew how to *ask* for a compiler:
// it looked for `etamil` on the PATH and, failing that, offered a download
// page. That is a poor first five minutes. The extension now carries the
// binary and the standard library in the VSIX, so a fresh install can check
// and run a file with nothing else installed at all.
//
// The order is settings, then carried, then PATH:
//
//   `etamil.compilerPath`   an explicit choice always wins, so a developer
//                           working on the compiler runs their own build.
//   the carried binary      what a new user gets, with no setup.
//   `etamil` on the PATH    a separate installation, or a platform this VSIX
//                           was not built for.
//
// `ETAMIL_PATH` matters as much as the binary. `இறக்கு "nUlakam/paNam.qmz"`
// resolves beside the importing file, then along `ETAMIL_PATH`, then beside
// the executable; a carried compiler whose library the caller cannot see is a
// compiler that refuses every import in the standard library.
