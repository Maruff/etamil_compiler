**Write Indian finance software in Tamil.**

[eTamil](https://etamil.in) is a programming language whose keywords and standard
library are Tamil, built for the work Indian finance and commerce actually
involves — ledgers, GST, income tax, payroll, costing, project accounting. Money
is decimal and exact, the tax rules are in the library rather than in a framework
you find later, and every keyword can be written in Tamil script or in ASCII.

**This extension carries the whole toolchain.** The compiler for your platform,
the 691-function `nUlakam` standard library, thirty-two example programs and the
eTamil font all travel inside it, so installing it is the entire installation —
no Rust, no download, nothing to put on your `PATH`.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **Syntax highlighting** | All 203 keywords across 545 spellings — Tamil script, romanized, and the English aliases |
| **Errors as you type** | From the compiler's own front end, so they are the errors you will actually get |
| **Completions** | Keywords with correct statement templates, 62 host builtins, and all 691 `செயல்` functions in the `nUlakam` standard library |
| **Hover** | Every spelling of a word, whether it is reserved, and the doc comment from its definition |
| **Signature help** | Parameter names, read from the library's own source |
| **Go to Definition** | Jumps into `nUlakam`, and to functions in the current file |
| **Outline** | Every `செயல்` in the file |
| **Run** | Run or serve the current file in a terminal |
| **Examples** | **eTamil: Open an example** — thirty-two working programs, carried in the extension |
| **Documentation** | **eTamil: Documentation…** — the manual, the playground and the reference on [etamil.in](https://etamil.in) |

Both spellings are first-class. Type `eZil` and you get a romanized template;
type `எனில்` and you get a Tamil one.

## What eTamil is

A language for a domain that punishes approximation. Three things follow from
building one for Indian finance rather than adapting a general-purpose language
to it.

**Money is exact.** `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.3`, not `0.30000000000000004`. Amounts are
decimal end to end, rounded to the paisa where the law says to, and `₹1,234.50`
is simply how a number prints. A tax calculator built on binary floating point
is wrong in a way nobody notices until an audit.

**The domain is in the standard library, not in a framework you find later.**
`nUlakam` is 691 functions: double-entry ledgers and trial balances; GST with
CGST, SGST and IGST; the income-tax ladder with rebate, surcharge, marginal
relief and cess; TDS and advance tax; depreciation; revenue recognition under
Ind AS 115; deferred tax under Ind AS 12; project costing with earned value and
the critical path; banking, UPI, customs and insurance.

**You can write it in Tamil script, or in ASCII.** Every keyword has up to three
spellings — `செயல்`, `ceyal`, `_fn` — and all three compile to the same token, so
a team uses whichever suits the keyboard in front of it.

Income tax, in the language:

```etamil
எண் வருவாய்;
அச்சு "Enter income: ";
உள்ளிடு வருவாய்;
வரி_வீதம் = 20%;

(வருவாய் > 800000) எனில் {
    அச்சு "Tax payable: " & வட்டமிடு((வருவாய் - 800000) * வரி_வீதம், 2);
}
இன்றேல் {
    அச்சு "No tax payable";
}
```

It is not a teaching language. Programs run on a bytecode VM, talk to SQLite,
PostgreSQL and MySQL, serve concurrent HTTP with routing, JSON, bcrypt and JWT,
and compile to WebAssembly to run in a browser.

## Learning eTamil

The extension knows the language. It does not teach it, and everything that
does is on **[etamil.in](https://etamil.in)**:

| | |
|---|---|
| [User manual](https://etamil.in/language/manual/) | Installation through to database-backed HTTP services, in order |
| [Playground](https://etamil.in/start/) | Run eTamil in the browser — the compiler, built to WebAssembly |
| [Language tour](https://etamil.in/language/) | The language in editable, runnable examples |
| [Keyword reference](https://etamil.in/language/keywords/) | Every keyword in all three spellings |
| [Finance and accounting](https://etamil.in/finance/) | Ledgers, GST, tax |
| [Databases and HTTP](https://etamil.in/server/) | Building services |
| [Status and roadmap](https://etamil.in/status/) | What works today, and what does not yet |
| [Source](https://github.com/Maruff/etamil_compiler) | The compiler, the library and this extension |

**eTamil: Documentation…** in the Command Palette opens any of them, and every
keyword hover links the reference for that word.

**eTamil: Open an example** is the shorter route. The extension carries the
repository's thirty-two example programs — the accounting framework, the HTTP
server, the GST invoice, the project-costing worked example — and opens a copy
you can edit and run. A copy, not the original: the extension directory is
replaced on every update.

## Errors never run your program

Diagnostics come from `etamil --check`, which lexes, parses and type checks and
then stops. That distinction matters for this language: an eTamil program writes
files, issues database queries and starts an HTTP server. Opening one in an
editor should not do any of that.

## Setup

There isn't any. **The extension carries the compiler.**

Inside it are the `etamil` binary for your platform and the whole nUlakam
standard library. Error checking, **eTamil: Run this file** and Go to Definition
into the library all work the moment the extension finishes installing — no
Rust, no download, no `PATH`. The Marketplace sends you the build for your
machine; installing a `.vsix` by hand means picking the one whose name ends in
your platform, `etamil-support-1.0.0-win32-x64.vsix`.

Three things are worth knowing about it.

**Your own compiler wins.** Set `etamil.compilerPath` and that is what runs — a
`cargo build` of the repository, say, or a release you installed yourself. The
carried one is only the default.

**A terminal cannot see inside an extension.** The editor runs the carried
binary where it lies, but `etamil` at a shell prompt is a different question,
and the extension directory is replaced wholesale on every update, so pointing
at it would break. **eTamil: Install the compiler for use outside the editor**
copies the binary and the library to `~/.local` — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\eTamil`
on Windows — and shows you the two lines that put them on `PATH` and
`ETAMIL_PATH`. It shows them rather than writing them: how every program on your
machine starts is not something an extension should change on its own.

**A platform with no build falls back.** If this VSIX carries nothing for your
platform and architecture, the extension looks for `etamil` on the `PATH` and
the install command offers the release package and the source build, as before.

By hand, the prebuilt package needs no Rust and no C toolchain:

```powershell
# Windows — https://github.com/Maruff/etamil_compiler/releases/latest
Expand-Archive etamil-windows-x64.zip -DestinationPath .
.\etamil-windows-x64\install.ps1
```

```bash
# Linux
tar -xzf etamil-linux-x64.tar.gz
./etamil-linux-x64/install.sh
```

```bash
# macOS — arm64 for Apple Silicon, x64 for Intel; `uname -m` tells you which.
tar -xzf etamil-macos-arm64.tar.gz
./etamil-macos-arm64/install.sh
# These builds are not notarized, so clear the quarantine flag once or
# Gatekeeper refuses to run them.
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/lib/etamil
```

The packages carry the PostgreSQL and MySQL drivers. Build from source for the
LLVM backend — Rust 1.85+ and a C toolchain, MSVC Build Tools with "Desktop
development with C++" on Windows and `cc` elsewhere:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maruff/etamil_compiler.git
cd etamil_compiler/etamil_compiler
cargo build --release
```

Either way the binary has to be on your `PATH` — the installers do that — or in
`etamil.compilerPath`.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `etamil.compilerPath` | *(carried, then PATH)* | Path to the `etamil` binary. Machine-scoped, because it names an executable the extension runs |
| `etamil.eTamilFont` | *(off)* | Font for ASCII that is eTamil rather than English — `ican qamiz` and `ican qamiz Smart` ship with the extension, see below |
| `etamil.checkOnType` | `true` | Report errors while you type |
| `etamil.intelliSense` | `true` | Completions and signature help |

## Two scripts in one file

eTamil is written three ways and two of them are the same bytes. `செயல்` is
Tamil. `ceyal` is the same word spelled under the ezuqqu scheme, where one Latin
letter stands for one Tamil letter. `_length` is English. The last two are both
ASCII, and nothing in the bytes separates them.

There is an **eTamil font** in which the ASCII letters carry Tamil glyphs — `c`
draws ச, `q` draws த, `Z` draws ன. It lets you write Tamil on an ASCII keyboard
and read it back as Tamil. Under it an English word is nonsense: `sum` draws as
ஸும்.

So the file says which is which, and the extension reads what it says:

```etamil
// __Rounded to paise once, at the end.__
_sum = moqqam;
```

**The extension carries two such fonts**, `ican qamiz` and `ican qamiz Smart`,
both under the SIL Open Font License. The plain face gives the ASCII letters
Tamil shapes and nothing else; the Smart face does the same, and adds 72
characters of the Tamil block and three contextual rules, so that one face sets
both a program and the prose about it. Those rules belong to the font and not to
the language — the compiler does not accept them in keywords, function names or
variables, because it requires the canonical form in which every vowel is
written. `fonts/README.md` records them.

Run **eTamil: Install the eTamil font** and it copies both files to your
own font directory — `~/Library/Fonts`, `~/.local/share/fonts`, or
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts` with the registry value Windows needs
— then offers to set `etamil.eTamilFont` to `ican qamiz Smart` for you. No
administrator rights, a dialog that says what it will write before it writes it,
and a restart of VS Code afterwards, because the font list is read when the
window starts.

The install command exists because shipping a font is not installing one. VS
Code's editor is not a webview and has no API that registers a font, so a
`font-family` only resolves against fonts the operating system already knows.

With the setting in place, `moqqam` is drawn in the eTamil face while `_sum`,
the comment between its `__` marks, every string literal and the licence header
stay in your ordinary editor font. **The editor's font is not changed.** It
stays the ISO stack and only the eTamil-script ASCII is painted over the top,
which matters more than it sounds. An English word drawn in either eTamil face
is unreadable — `sum` draws as ஸும் — and nothing outside the two marks says
which ASCII letters were English, so painting the whole editor in an eTamil face
would make every English run unreadable. A span the extension fails to recognise
then renders eTamil as plain Latin, the usual view of the file, rather than
English in Tamil glyphs. It also leaves the base font carrying every `மொத்தம்`
in the file, which the plain face could not draw at all.

One caveat. Both faces are proportional, not monospaced, so a painted run does
not sit on the same grid as the code around it and text after it on the same
line shifts. A monospaced build of the face would make that exact and nothing
in the extension would change.

The two marks are the language's, not the extension's:
[SCRIPT_RULES.md](https://github.com/Maruff/etamil_compiler/blob/main/docs/reference/SCRIPT_RULES.md) specifies them,
`scripts/check_script_rules.py` gates them, and `fonts/README.md` records what
is in the font file.

## Tamil rendering

The extension sets a font stack for eTamil files that names Tamil faces before
the monospace fallback. Most programming fonts carry no Tamil glyphs at all and
fall back mid-line, which makes a line of source jump around as you read it. If
your editor still renders Tamil unevenly, install
[Noto Sans Tamil](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Tamil) and
put it first in `editor.fontFamily` for `[etamil]`.

## Romanized spelling

eTamil's romanization keeps Tamil's three nasals apart: **ண = `N`, ந = `n`,
ன = `Z`**. So the conditional is `eZil`, not `enil`, and the float type is
`piZZam`, not `pinnam`.

Versions of this extension before 0.3.0 shipped the older scheme, where ந and
ன both used `n`. The effect was backwards: the spellings the editor highlighted
were the ones the compiler rejected, and the ones it accepted got no
highlighting. If you have romanized eTamil written against a pre-0.3.0
extension, it needs updating — see the [letter equivalents
guide](https://github.com/Maruff/etamil_compiler/blob/main/docs/reference/COMPILER_TAMIL_LETTER_EQUIVALENTS.md).

## Contributing

**The keyword lists are generated. Do not edit them by hand.**

`syntaxes/etamil.tmLanguage.json` and `src/generated/language-data.ts` are
produced from the compiler:

```bash
python ../scripts/generate_editor_support.py
```

It reads the keywords and their spellings from `etamil_compiler/src/lexer.rs`,
whether each one is reserved from `src/parser.rs`, the builtins from
`src/vm/interpreter.rs`, and the standard library from `nUlakam/**/*.qmz`.
Nothing is restated here, which is the point — a second hand-kept copy is what
drifted before.

CI runs `--check`, which fails if the committed files no longer match the
compiler. Add a keyword to the lexer, and the build tells you to regenerate.

What is *not* generated is the shape of each statement — `(cond) எனில் { }`
cannot be inferred from a token name. Those templates live in the `SNIPPETS`
table in the generator and in `snippets/etamil.code-snippets`, and every one of
them is fed to the real compiler by `test/snippets.test.js`.

```bash
npm install
npm run verify     # generated files current, tsc, eslint, tests
```

The test suite has two parts. `test/grammar.test.js` loads the grammar with
vscode-textmate and asserts scopes — including that `\b` behaves correctly
around Tamil combining marks, which is what stops `எண்` matching inside
`எண்ணி`. `test/snippets.test.js` compiles every snippet.
