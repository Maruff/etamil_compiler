// those claims is typed by hand while the real figure moves on its own — one
// commit to nUlakam and the page is wrong, with nothing anywhere to say so.
//
// It has gone wrong twice. The page offered "23 host builtins and all 122
// `செயல்` functions" long after they were 62 and 681; the fix said 681 on a day
// when the answer had already become 691. Both were found by a person reading
// the page, which is not a mechanism.
//
// So the page is held to `src/generated/language-data.ts`, which is generated
// from lexer.rs, parser.rs, interpreter.rs and nUlakam itself. A number that
// drifts now fails a test rather than shipping.
//
//   node --test test/counts.test.js
//
// Requires `npm run build`.
