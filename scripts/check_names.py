"""Audit the romanized names that are not keywords.

`transliterate.py --check` holds the lexer's keyword table to the scheme. It
reads `lexer.rs` and nothing else, which leaves every *other* romanized surface
unaudited — module and file names, SQL tables and columns, and the record keys
those columns become when a row is read.

That is the gap `viziqam` fell through. `விகிதம்` is `vikiqam`; `viziqam` is
`z`, ழ, and spells nothing. It was never a keyword, so nothing checked it, and
it spread from a module name into a table, a column and a second module before
anyone read it aloud.

## How it decides

The scheme assigns one Latin letter per Tamil letter, so it inverts. Run a name
back through `untransliterate` and one of three things happens:

    kaNakkiyal   -> கணக்கியல்      all Tamil. On-scheme; whether it is a *word*
                                    is a question only a reader can answer.
    products     -> ப்ரொdஉச்ட்ஸ்    Tamil with Latin still in it. `d` is not in
                                    the scheme, so it had nothing to become.
    calculator   -> சல்சுலடொர்      all Tamil, because c, a, l, u, t, o and r
                                    all happen to be scheme letters.

The second is the bug this catches: a letter outside the scheme sitting inside
a Tamil word. `b`, `d`, `f`, `g` and `D` are not in the scheme at all, so
`muDivu`, `kadaZ` and `kadai` cannot round-trip and are reported.

The third is why English names need an allowlist and why this audit cannot be
total: a name spelled only in scheme letters produces Tamil whether or not
Tamil was meant. Digraphs borrowed from ISO 15919 have the same problem — `ai`,
`zh` and `th` are all scheme letters in sequence — so they are checked by name.

## What it does not do

It cannot tell a real Tamil word from a plausible one. `viziqam` reverses
cleanly to விழிதம், which is on-scheme and means nothing; only a reader caught
that. This narrows the field to names a reader should look at, and stops the
letters that are wrong on their face.
