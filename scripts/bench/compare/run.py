"""Time the same slab-tax loop in every language installed on this machine.

    python scripts/bench/compare/run.py
    python scripts/bench/compare/run.py --repeats 7 --target-ms 600

Four things this does that a `time`-in-a-loop does not, each because the first
version of it produced a wrong number without saying so.

**Per-iteration cost comes from two workload sizes, not one.** Creating a
process on this class of Windows machine costs 110-140 ms before a single
instruction of the program runs — anti-malware scans every image — and it is
noisy enough that "total minus an empty program" produced *negative* compute
times for C and Rust. Timing at `N` and at `2N` and taking the difference
cancels every constant: process creation, runtime startup, parsing, printing.
What is left is the loop.

    ns/iteration = (T(2N) - T(N)) * 1e6 / N

**It sizes the workload per language.** A loop that takes eTamil a second takes
C microseconds. Each implementation is calibrated so its own compute time
reaches `--target-ms`; without that the fast end of the table reads 0 ms, which
is a missing measurement pretending to be a result.

**It checks the answer.** Every implementation must print the same digits as an
exact rational computed here before its timing is reported. A benchmark that
computes the wrong thing quickly is not a fast benchmark.

**It reports whether the loop survived the optimiser.** This computation is a
triangular sum, and at `/O2` a C or Rust compiler is entitled to replace the
whole loop with a closed form. When that happens T(2N) - T(N) collapses towards
zero, and the row is marked rather than quietly reported as a hundred-fold win.

Timings are the *minimum* of the repeats. The minimum is the run least polluted
by other work on the machine; a mean on a desktop measures the desktop.
