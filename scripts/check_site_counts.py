"""Audit the keyword counts published on etamil.in against the lexer.

The website states how many keywords the language has in thirteen places --
the home page's statistics, the keyword reference, the manual, the status
table, the tour -- and every one of them is a number typed by hand. They go
stale the moment a keyword lands, and they did: a token and five standard
library functions were added and the site went on saying 202 tokens across 541
spellings when the answer was 203 and 545. Nobody reading the site can tell.

`eTamil_Code/test/counts.test.js` already guards the extension's figures for
this reason. This does the same for the site, from the same source: the token
table in `lexer.rs`, read through `generate_editor_support.py` rather than
parsed a second time here.

    python scripts/check_site_counts.py
    python scripts/check_site_counts.py --check          # exit 1 on a mismatch
    python scripts/check_site_counts.py --site ../eTamil # an explicit checkout

The site is a separate repository, so it has to be found before it can be
read: `--site`, then `$ETAMIL_SITE`, then `../eTamil_site` and `../eTamil`
beside this one. **Finding no checkout is not a failure** -- it reports that it
skipped and exits 0, so the check is a no-op for anyone who has only cloned the
compiler, and CI adds a second checkout to make it gate.

What is not checked, deliberately: a sentence recording what a past change did.
`524 spellings across 202 tokens, up from 505` is history and its numbers are
the point of it, so any line saying `up from` is left alone.

The patterns below are the phrasings the site actually uses. A new way of
writing the same claim needs a pattern adding, which is the honest limitation
of checking prose: this catches the sentences it knows, and says which ones
those are.
