# Compare the two backends: does --llvm produce the same answers as --vm?
#
# The VM is the reference. It runs the whole language, and every example is
# expected to work under it. The LLVM backend covers less, and refuses what it
# cannot build rather than emitting IR that computes something else — so for
# most programs the honest result today is "refused", not "wrong".
#
# That refusal is the point of this script. Each one names the constructs that
# stopped it, and the summary counts them, so the gap between the backends is
# a list of things to build rather than an impression.

#   ./scripts/run_parity.sh --diff nUlakam/upi/upi_cOqaZY.qmz
#
# The second form runs one program under both backends and shows where their
# output parts company. The summary form reports *that* two backends disagree
# and never about what, which made every MISMATCH cost a round trip.
#
# Needs a binary built with the LLVM feature:
#
#   (cd etamil_compiler && cargo build --release --features llvm)
#
# If it finds one built without, it says so and exits 0 — a machine that
# cannot build LLVM (Windows, today) is not a failing machine.
#
# Where clang is on PATH, an accepted program is taken all the way: IR is
# compiled, the binary is run, and its output is compared against the VM's.
# Without clang the IR is accepted as far as it goes and reported separately,
# because "it compiled" and "it computes the same thing" are different claims.
#
# The emitted IR is not self-contained. Every eTamil value in it is a handle
# into an arena in `crate::runtime`, and every operation on one is a call into
# the cdylib that Cargo already builds beside the binary — which is what makes
# decimals exact and all fifty-nine builtins reachable. So the link needs it,
# and needs an rpath so the built program can find it again when it runs.
