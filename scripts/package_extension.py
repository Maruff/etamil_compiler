"""Build VS Code extension packages that carry the compiler.

Installing the extension used to be half an installation. The other half was a
release page, a download, an archive, an install script and a PATH edit — five
steps between someone deciding to try eTamil and seeing a program run, each one
a place to stop. The extension now carries the `etamil` binary and the nUlakam
standard library inside the VSIX, so the half is the whole.

That means one VSIX per platform, which is what `vsce package --target` is for.
A user installing from the Marketplace gets the build for their machine and
never sees the others; a user installing a `.vsix` by hand picks the one whose
name says their platform.

## The layout

    eTamil_Code/bin/<platform>-<arch>/etamil[.exe]     one per target
    eTamil_Code/runtime/nUlakam/**                     shared
    eTamil_Code/runtime/examples/**                    shared

`src/bundle.ts` computes those paths and `src/toolchain.ts` reads them, keyed
on `process.platform` and `process.arch` — the same pair VS Code's own target
names are built from, which is why the directory is named that way rather than
after the target string.

The library is not repeated per target. It is eTamil source, identical on every
platform, and `ETAMIL_PATH` is what points the compiler at it.

It is carried even where the compiler has the library built in, because Go to
Definition opens a file and a copy compiled into an executable is not one.

Both directories are git-ignored. They are build output, and the source of both
is already in this repository.

## Where the binaries come from

    --binary <path>       a file you built, for the current platform
    --from-dist           the packages ./packaging/build.sh left in dist/
    --from-release <tag>  downloaded from a GitHub release

A release build uses `--from-release`, because those archives are the artifacts
that were tested, and because no one machine can build all four targets.

## Usage

    python scripts/package_extension.py --stage                # current platform only
    python scripts/package_extension.py --from-dist            # stage and package
    python scripts/package_extension.py --from-release v1.0.0  # every target

`--stage` stops after copying the files in, which is what you want when you are
about to press F5 in the extension host: the carried compiler is then the one
your debug session uses.
