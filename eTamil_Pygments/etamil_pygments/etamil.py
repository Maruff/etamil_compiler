    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Lexer for eTamil, a programming language whose keywords are Tamil words.

    The word lists live in `_etamil_builtins.py` and are generated from the
    compiler's own lexer, so the vocabulary here cannot drift from the language.
    Everything that decides how a word is *coloured* is in this file.
